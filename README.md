Welcome to Project Lucidity

At its core, Project Lucidity is a sleep mask that helps you attain the elusive lucid dream. But this project is more than that. Its about taking the art of controlling your dreams and bringing it from a shaky phenomenon to a more understood science. To do so, Project Lucidity was designed as a fully featured, hobbyist and developer friendly, lucid dreaming mask that goes above and beyond. 

For more information about the project, check out the main website at: www.projectlucidity.com

All the code, schematics, and eagle files have been uploaded into this github. Feel free to utilize this information for your personal designs but please check the Liscence file for any concerns about the contents use.
