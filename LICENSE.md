The project source is completely viewable and downloadable on Github. I have attached my commented code, the circuit schematic, and a Eagle board file if you want to get the project printed yourself. In addition, I have attached a parts list which will help you assemble the project yourself. The purpose of this project is to better the maker community with a functional design and thus is free to be built on a personal scale.
