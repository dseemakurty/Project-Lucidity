Integrating the Sleep Mask into your current application could not be easier. The cell phone
and the transmitting module are interfaced by a simple headphone jack. This allows for audio
to convey the data from the smartphone to the transmitting module. 

Proper Message Encoding:
	The transmitter module will accept any integer (up to 16 bits) which it then transmits to
	the mask. This integer describes which pattern will be displayed, the speed setting, and
	the brightness setting of each pattern.
	
	These settings are analyzed from the integer by reading the value of each digit of the int.
	The ones digit contains the brightness level (9 being brightest), the tens digit contains
	the pattern speed level (9 being the fastest), and any digits above the tens digit denote
	the pattern itself.
	
	For example: int 374
	4 = brightness factor
	7 = speed factor
	3 = pattern
	
	For example: int 1359
	9 = brightness factor
	5 = speed factor
	13 = pattern
	
	The default setting for every pattern should be a speed and brightness setting of 5.
	One exception to this rule is for pattern #1, which is the daylight simulation, the
	speed setting should be set to 0 and brightness to 9.
	
	The patterns are:
	#1: Daylight Simulation
	#2: Flash All LEDs (blinks both eye's leds at same time)
	#3: Sweep Pattern (sweeps the leds from left side to the right side and back)
	#4: Alternating Flash (flashes left eye, then right eye)
	#5: Double Flash (flash all leds twice quickly, then pause for a longer time)
	...More to come....
	
Creating the Message:
	The transmitter understands the audio signal only if it is encoded in a proper way.
	The integer is encoded into the audio signal by converting the integer into binary 
	(and ensuring it is not longer than 16 bits) and then for each bit, appending one of 
	three audio clips together. There are four wav audio files which should be included
	with the application; bit1.wav, bit0.wav, bitNull.wav, startBit.wav
	
	For each bit of the integer, based on whether the bit is a 1 or 0, append the proper
	wav bit to the startBit.wav. After appending each bit's audio file of the integer,
	finally append the bitNull.wav file. This creates a complete audio message that
	encapsulates the integer and can be interpreted by the transmitter module.
	
	The total size of all four wav files is only 2KB so its very easy to implement into
	the program. Because of of the small size of each part, the message audio file is also
	very small, lasting on average about 20ms for a 10 bit integer to 30ms for a 16bit integer. 
	However, because transmitter module will generally be in a polling mode to conserve
	battery, this short message needs to be repeated continuously for 60 seconds to ensure
	proper delivery of the message. 
	
Pattern Preview Feature:
	Since the mask can be customized in these multiple ways, the user will want to be able
	to preview the different settings as he/she changes them. To allow for this, when the
	mask and transmitter are first powered on, they are put into a quick polling mode for
	two minutes. During these two minutes, any audio signals sent by the smartphone will 
	be quickly picked up by the transmitter and relayed to the mask. To properly implement
	this feature, there should be a preview button in the settings page which transmits 
	the current settings for a brief 4 seconds. When the mask receives the new settings,
	it will display the designated pattern for a short time so the user can check out the 
	settings.
	
	
When Mask should be Triggered:
	The sleep mask should be triggered on two occasions. 
		1. The user had entered REM sleep and is in sleep paralysis. During this time, can
		be identified as abnormally low accelerometer movement for a set time, the mask 
		should be triggered with the lucid dreaming pattern.
		2. When its the optimal time to wake up, the mask can be triggered to initiate the
		daylight simulation feature. This feature by default settings (pattern:1, speed:0,
		brightness:9) will run at full brightness for 5 minutes. During which time the 
		white LEDs will be getting increasing brighter to help awaken a user.
